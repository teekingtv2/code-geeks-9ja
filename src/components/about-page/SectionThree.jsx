                Our Affiliation with Jaflah Software Development Company is the mother company of
                Code Geeks 9ja. This affiliation births the incredible feature that differentiates
                Code Geeks 9ja from other IT institutes in the country as it allows our trainees to
                have direct access to production applications coding. As an engineer, there are
                issues that you would only face on production apps. As well, there is a limit to
                what you can learn and experience by building test apps locally on your computers.
                Things can become a little scarier in live apps. And so you do not get lost when you
                face job interviews or pushed into a heavy code base, outside our horizons, we give
                you the opportunity to equip yourself and strengthen your portfolio with proven live
                applications. This is priceless and will only benefit you greatly as you dive into
                the ocean of job opportunities in the software development world.
