                    Code Geeks 9ja is a tech training institute that offers
                    training services to individuals to master the act of coding
                    the right way. It provides effective private trainings and
                    personified learning experiences that are designed to make
                    individuals master software development skills rather than
                    becoming just another average developers, and beyond just
                    being a good coder, a top professional at it.

                    Software development is a very high paying job. However, it
                    is not as easy to learn. With statistics showing that over
                    60% trainees end up abandoning the career pursuit due to the
                    complexity of software development and the level of
                    commitment required. There are various training centres in
                    the country already but we have verified that most of these
                    training institutes treat it as a business rather than
                    mentorship for career growth. Students are often left
                    confused about the next line of action following the
                    completion of training programs which in most cases lasts
                    for 6 months. What is more, training institutes are more
                    concerned about getting the next batch of trainees rather
                    than establishing that the courses were successfully learnt,
                    skills were confidently acquired, and also provide the
                    needed guidance following the completion of the program.
